Churn Prediction Project

This project involves predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques, aimed at helping businesses understand and mitigate customer attrition.

Overview
Churn prediction is critical for businesses in various industries to retain customers and optimize business strategies. This project utilizes historical customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes historical customer information and churn status. It encompasses attributes such as customer demographics, usage patterns, transaction history, and a churn label indicating whether the customer churned (1) or not (0).

Methodology
 
Data Collection: Gathered comprehensive data on customer interactions, including demographics and usage metrics.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as required for machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted exploratory analysis to understand data distributions, correlations, and key factors influencing churn.

Feature Engineering: Engineered new features and transformed existing ones to capture meaningful patterns and enhance model performance.

Model Selection: Evaluated various machine learning algorithms suitable for binary classification tasks, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained models on the dataset, evaluated their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve analysis.

Prediction and Deployment: Applied the best-performing model to make predictions on new data. If applicable, deployed the model for real-time churn prediction in a production environment.

Results
The project achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set, indicating robust performance in predicting customer churn. Insights gained from the analysis can help businesses implement targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
